## What I built

A responsive landing page inspired by the _Bankist_ design. Implemented:

- Semantic HTML structure
- CSS Grid & Flexbox layouts
- Responsive breakpoints for mobile / tablet / desktop
- Simple slider and modal
- Lazy loading for images

## Credit

Design and original concept by **Jonas Schmedtmann**.  
This repository contains my own implementation and CSS/JS adaptations made for learning and portfolio purposes.

> **Note:** The original design is by Jonas Schmedtmann. This project is intended _only_ for learning and portfolio demonstration — not for teaching, resale, or claiming as the original design.
